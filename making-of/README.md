# Making of: 3D Chess in React

Recently I made a tiny demo where I implemented a subset of the chess game, made it in 3D and implemented using React exclusively for the job. It will be a quick summary of what and how happened.

## Models

I some have experience with Blender so I quickly put together a set of geometric (Bauhaus style) pieces.

## Three.js in React

In order to display them I had to go for WebGL as usual with 3D rendering on the web. [Normally](https://tchayen.github.io/brief-explanation-of-webgl/) I like to do it all myself, but this time I decided that maybe instead of spending a week on proving a point that I can do it myself I might rather finish a project.

So here we go, Three.js to make handling 3D easier than usual and `react-three-fiber` because it exists and I really want to check it out.

First thing that is mind blowing to me is that I can write Three.js as React. How? Custom renderers. There is a great [talk from React Conf 2019](https://conf.reactjs.org/event.html?sophiebits) that explains how it works.

A kind of magic and somehow it goes well with regular React too, so sometimes it might be tricky to remember about all caveats that apply there. For example, rendering context is not passed to the inner renderer, so if you have a state library with a state provider outside in the React context, you will have to [pass it to the inside one](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/blob/master/markdown/api.md#consuming-context-from-a-foreign-provider).

This is how it looks like in practice:

```jsx
<Canvas
  concurrent
  pixelRatio={[1, 2]}
  camera={{ position: [4, 10, 0] }}
>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.3} />
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    {/* ... */}
```

### Chessboard

Not everything has to be modelled and imported. For example chessboard is easy to achieve using simple shapes (simplified `Square.tsx`):

```jsx
<group position={[x, 0, y]}>
  <mesh>
    <boxBufferGeometry attach="geometry" args={[size, 0, size]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color={color} />
  </mesh>
</group>
```

It can be probably even simpler than this since if I remember correctly there is `Plane` as a primitive type but I haven't looked into that too much.

## Implementing chess

Basically all game logic happens in one place here â€“ when showing available moves. It is probably not the most readable or concise you will see, but was very quick to come up with and implement.

For a given coordinate, I check:
- If there is a piece on it.
- What is its type.

I have helper that checks a given direction (specified as `{ x: -1 | 0 | 1, y: -1 | 0 | 1 }`, which allows to express any diagonal, horizontal or vertical movement in both directions) and goes on until:
- It goes out of the chessboard.
- It exceeds range (usually no limit, implemented as `8`, or 1 field).
- It finds another piece (if ally then skip, if enemy then recognize it as possible attack move).

For pawns I use a coincidence (but I don't really have to worry about the rules of chess changing or getting more complex any time soon, right?) which assumes that a white pawn on `y === 6` or a black one on `y === 1` is entitled to make the initial, 2-field-long move.

I haven't implemented castling, promotion or en passant as I was able to get away with not having them for the demo video (oops).

## State updates

The game can be in one of the following states:
- Nothing is happening.
- User is hovering their piece.
- User has picked up a piece, and, as we all know after watching Queen's Gambit, they are obliged to make a move with it now (it's not a bug, it's a feature!).

As a lazy React developer, I put all the actual logic wherever the final press event is handled. It happened to be in `HoverableSquare`, as it is displayed over the fields that user can move to.

### What happens then?

I check if there is some piece on the target field (then it's an attack) or not (a move). I update my `field -> Piece | null` mapping array (most likely buggy, but works reasonably well for the first few moves).

Then the tricky part happens: `hovered` element becomes `null` (re-render alert for `<AvailableMoves />` and `<Figures />; basically pink color disappears from the screen). Game state is updated (the changes I mentioned in the previous paragraph come to live and current turn is passed to the other player).

## Getting fancy

Presentation is unarguably important aspect. It's most likely the deciding factor for the fact that you are actually reading this note.

I have (limited) experience with 3D modelling and wanted to finish it quickly so I went for simple tricks: directional lighting to make anything visible, shadows for being realistic and additional point lights for fancy glares.

_You versus the chessboard she tells you not to worry about meme._

## Left to do

This demo lacks at least several things:
- Being a complete chess game (there are missing moves, there is no way to win or lose the game, nothing).
- Animations (`react-spring` should be perfect for the job).
- More UI to show what's going on.

## Thanks for reading!

Hope it was informative and met your expectations. If any part was unclear or you have any more questions feel free to mention/DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tchayen).

I think it's also a good place to thank people without whom I wouldn't be writing it now:
- [@wojtus_7](https://twitter.com/wojtus_7), my friend who started playing with chess-oriented demo recently and inspired me to give it a try.
- [@0xca0a](https://twitter.com/0xca0a), who is the person behind `react-three-fiber`.
- [@aivandroid](https://twitter.com/aivandroid), who asked me to create a blog/video of the development process.

Have a great day!
